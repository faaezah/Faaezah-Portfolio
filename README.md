# 🌟 Faaezah — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a curated space where I bring together my work in software development, leadership, and academic exploration. I built this site to reflect who I am: intentional, technically sharp, and deeply committed to growth.

## ✨ About Me
I’m a software lead, builder, and problem‑solver with a strong focus on creating tools, systems, and experiences that make people’s lives easier. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and design — where clarity, structure, and creativity meet.

My work spans:

- AI‑assisted tools and chatbots  
- Technical leadership and team coordination  
- Academic and research‑driven projects  
- Elegant, user‑centered design  

I value clean architecture, thoughtful storytelling, and building things that feel polished and purposeful.
